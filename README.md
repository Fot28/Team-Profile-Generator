# Team Profile Generator

## Description

The Team Profile Generator is a command-line application that allows you to create a webpage displaying your software engineering team. The application prompts you to enter information about the team manager and additional team members, such as engineers and interns. It then generates an HTML file that showcases the team members with their respective roles, IDs, emails, and other role-specific information.

The generated webpage provides an easy-to-read summary of your team's members, making it convenient to access their contact information and roles.
